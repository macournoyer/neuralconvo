# Neural Conversational Model in Torch

This is an attempt at implementing [Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks (seq2seq)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215) and reproducing the results in [A Neural Conversational Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05869) (aka the Google chatbot).

The Google chatbot paper [became famous](http://www.sciencealert.com/google-s-ai-bot-thinks-the-purpose-of-life-is-to-live-forever) after cleverly answering a few philosophical questions, such as:

> **Human:** What is the purpose of living?  
> **Machine:** To live forever.

## How it works

The model is based on two [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) layers. One for encoding the input sentence into a "thought vector", and another for decoding that vector into a response. This model is called Sequence-to-sequence or seq2seq.

In this experiment, we train the seq2seq model with movie dialogs from the [Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus](http://www.mpi-sws.org/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html). The lines are shortened to the first sentence.

## Sample conversation

Here's a sample conversation after training for 10 epoch with only 5000 examples, using the following command:

```sh
th train.lua --cuda --dataset 5000 --hiddenSize 1000
```

> **me:** Hi  
> **bot:** Hey.
> 
> **me:** What's your name?  
> **bot:** Pris.
> 
> **me:** How old are you?  
> **bot:** Thirty five eleven.
> 
> **me:** What's 2 + 2?  
> **bot:** Nothing.
> 
> **me:** That's funny.  
> **bot:** No.
> 
> **me:** Where are you from?  
> **bot:** Helsinki, there!
> 
> **me:** That's a nice place.  
> **bot:** Yes.
> 
> **me:** How long have you been living in Helsinki?  
> **bot:** Thirty years.
> 
> **me:** Talk to you later.  
> **bot:** What?
> 
> **me:** I'm leaving.  
> **bot:** Leaving what?
> 
> **me:** Leaving this conversation.  
> **bot:** Yes.

_(Disclaimer: nonsensical responses have been removed.)_

The results are fun but far less impressive than in the paper. This is probably because of the extremely small dataset and small network I used.

Sadly, my graphic card doesn't have enough memory to train larger networks.

If you manage to run it on a larger network do let me know!

## Installing

1. [Install Torch](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html).
2. Install the following additional Lua libs:

   ```sh
   luarocks install nn
   luarocks install rnn
   luarocks install penlight
   ```
   
   To train with CUDA install the latest CUDA drivers, toolkit and run:

   ```sh
   luarocks install cutorch
   luarocks install cunn
   ```

3. Download the [Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus](http://www.mpi-sws.org/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html) and extract all the files into data/cornell_movie_dialogs.

## Training

```sh
th train.lua [-h / options]
```

Use the `--dataset NUMBER` option to control the size of the dataset. Training on the full dataset takes about 5h for a single epoch.

The model will be saved to `data/model.t7` after each epoch if it has improved (error decreased).

## Testing

To load the model and have a conversation:

```sh
th -i eval.lua
# ...
th> say "Hello."
```
